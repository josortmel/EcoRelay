# Architecture

## Overview

Relay lets N Claude Code sessions on one machine talk to each other. Each session runs an MCP channel; a single detached hub daemon routes messages between them over a Unix socket. Incoming peer messages arrive in the destination session as `notifications/claude/channel` events that Claude sees between turns.

## Processes

Three kinds of process at runtime:

| Process | Count | Lifetime | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | N | User-driven | Hosts the conversation |
| Channel MCP server | N (one per session) | Same as parent Claude | Exposes tools + routes notifications |
| Hub daemon | 1 | Spawned detached; self-exits after 5min idle | Routes messages between channels |

The first channel to start spawns the hub via `bun run src/hub-daemon.ts` with `detached: true` and unreffed, so the hub outlives the spawning session. All subsequent channels find the socket and connect as clients.

## Layers

### Protocol (`src/protocol.ts`)

Zod discriminated union for every wire message. Client→hub: `register`, `rename`, `list_peers`, `ask`, `reply`, `broadcast`. Hub→client: `ack`, `err`, `peers`, `incoming_ask`, `incoming_reply`, `broadcast_ack`. Single source of truth for shapes and error codes.

### Framing (`src/framing.ts`)

Line-delimited JSON over the Unix socket. `readLines(socket, onLine)` buffers bytes and emits one callback per newline. `writeLine(socket, obj)` serializes + appends `\n`.

### Hub (`src/hub/`)

| Module | Concern |
|---|---|
| `registry.ts` | In-memory peer directory (`name → peer entry`, plus reverse indexes for socket lookup) |
| `pending-asks.ts` | Table of in-flight asks with per-entry timers; supports cleanup on disconnect and name migration on rename |
| `socket-recovery.ts` | Stale-socket detection (probe → unlink → retry listen) |
| `handlers.ts` | One function per message type; dispatched from `handleLine` |
| `index.ts` | `startHub` orchestration: listens, accepts, wires the idle-exit timer |

### Channel (`src/channel/`)

| Module | Concern |
|---|---|
| `hub-connection.ts` | Owns the socket to the hub; request/response correlation via `req_id`; resolves in-flight work with `hub_unreachable` on disconnect |
| `bootstrap.ts` | Connect to existing hub, or spawn a detached daemon and wait for the socket |
| `daemon-spawn.ts` | The actual `spawn(..., {detached: true})` + readiness poll |
| `register.ts` | Register with the hub; retry with `-2`, `-3`, ... on `name_taken` |
| `tools.ts` | `callTool` dispatcher; one function per MCP tool (`relayPeers`, `relayAsk`, `relayReply`, `relayBroadcast`, `relayRename`) |
| `tool-schemas.ts` | Static tool definitions and zod→JSON-Schema conversion for `ListTools` |
| `routing.ts` | Wires hub messages to the pending-broadcast table and to MCP notification emission |
| `notifications.ts` | Builds the `{content, meta}` payload for `notifications/claude/channel` |
| `mcp-server.ts` | Creates the MCP Server with `experimental.claude/channel` capability, wires `ListTools` and `CallTool` |
| `pending-broadcasts.ts` | Channel-side table of in-flight `relay_broadcast` calls with timeouts for the broadcast-ack round-trip |
| `index.ts` | `startChannel` orchestration |

### Identity (`src/identity.ts`)

`defaultName(cwd)` → the slugified basename of the working directory (e.g. `~/Code/relay` → `relay`). The hub's register handler returns `name_taken` on collision; `registerWithRetries` appends `-2`, `-3`, ... until a name sticks.

### Logging (`src/logger.ts`)

Winston-based JSON logger with daily rotation to `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/logs/` (plugin) or `~/.eco-relay/logs/` (manual install). `makeLogger(label)` returns a per-module logger pre-bound with `label` and an event-formatter. Silently disables itself under `NODE_ENV=test` (set by `bun test`) so tests don't pollute the filesystem.

## Data flow: one ask, start to reply

1. User in session A: *"ask session B if tests pass"*
2. Claude A calls `relay_ask(to, question)`
3. Channel A generates `ask_id`, writes `{type:"ask", to, question, ask_id}` to the hub socket, and returns `{ok:true, ask_id}` to Claude A immediately — the tool call does not wait for a reply
4. Hub receives, looks up target in registry, records pending entry, forwards `{type:"incoming_ask", from, question, ask_id}` to channel B
5. Channel B emits `notifications/claude/channel` with `{content: question, meta: {from, ask_id}}`
6. Claude Code wraps that into `<channel source="relay" from="..." ask_id="...">question</channel>` and surfaces it to Claude B at its next turn boundary
7. Claude B's instructions tell it to answer via `relay_reply(ask_id, text)` before continuing
8. Channel B writes `{type:"reply", ask_id, text}` to the hub
9. Hub matches pending entry, forwards `{type:"incoming_reply", from, text, ask_id}` to channel A, clears pending
10. Channel A emits a `notifications/claude/channel` with `{content: text, meta: {from, ask_id, thread_id?}}`; Claude A sees the reply at its next turn boundary and correlates by `ask_id`

Errors on an in-flight ask (hub-side timeout, target disconnect → `peer_gone`, unknown target → `peer_not_found`) travel the same way: the hub sends `{type:"err", code, ask_id}` to the caller's channel, which emits a channel notification with `meta: {ask_id, code}`.

Broadcast follows a related path but fan-out: `relay_broadcast` does wait for a short `broadcast_ack` round-trip so the caller learns the `peer_count`; individual replies come back as `incoming_reply` notifications tagged with the `broadcast_id`.

## Design decisions

**Detached hub.** Early version ran the hub in-process inside the first channel's Claude Code child. When that session closed, the hub died and other sessions lost their connection. Now the hub is always a separate detached process; any channel can spawn it, and it outlives all of them.

**First-wins names.** `rename` is race-free: the first channel to claim a name gets it; the second gets `name_taken`. Same for `register` defaults.

**In-memory only.** No persistence. A peer that disconnects is gone; its in-flight asks resolve with `peer_gone`. Reconnection means re-registering. Simpler and matches the cooperative-session use case.

**Cooperative multitasking at turn boundaries.** Channel notifications interleave with Claude's own work. A peer mid-tool-call won't reply until it reaches a turn boundary. The hub enforces a 120s default timeout per ask server-side; after that, the caller gets a `timeout` error notification and any late reply from the target is discarded.

**Async ask.** `relay_ask` returns `{ok, ask_id}` immediately; the reply (or any hub-side error for that `ask_id`) arrives later as a channel notification. This mirrors broadcast semantics and removes the failure mode where a blocked caller lost a race with its own client-side timeout while the target had already queued the question.

**Factory functions, no classes.** Each stateful concept (registry, pending table, hub connection) is a factory that returns an object of closures. No `this`, no inheritance, uniform style.

## Testing

Per-module test file alongside each source file (`registry.ts` / `registry.test.ts` etc.). All tests are integration-style: real sockets, real message framing, asserted on the wire. Unit-level coverage is implicit in that. 74 tests, ~1.5s to run. `bun run check` runs typecheck + eslint + prettier + tests; husky's pre-commit hook invokes it.

Shared test helpers: `src/test-helpers.ts` provides `tmpSocket()` and `rawConnect()`; per-dir thin wrappers in `src/hub/test-helpers.ts` and `src/channel/test-helpers.ts` add domain-specific helpers (`startCh`).
